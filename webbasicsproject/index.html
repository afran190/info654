        <h3> Artist Statement</h3>
        <p> The first spiritualists were heavily influenced by telecommunication technologies of the
            mid-nineteenth century like the telegraph. The Fox Sisters first interactions with the ghost of the
            peddler were labeled as the “Rochester Rappings”. Adapting with technology, the camera could
            be viewed as a planchette, but at the same time that is not such a different concept from the spirit
            photographers of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. Green-Wood, acting as a
            refuge for those in the Victorian era and for me presently, evokes this connection to the past and
            enables the use of a camera as a tool of dialogue to convey the transition between life and death.
            The images in this series capture the subliminal space between these transformations,
            representing the muddled communications of mediums from the past and giving a depiction to
            the enigma of departure.</p>
